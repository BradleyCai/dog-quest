Dog Quest is a shoot-em up game inspired by Japanese Danmaku games. It has been developed in Unity with C#.

## Features

Dog Quest is still a work in progress. There is one playable demo level, and four bosses to try out.

The platform Dog Quest is built on currently supports:
- Bullet variety (linear, homing, and lazer)
- Enemy variety (custom path following, gun placement, health values, and score values)
- Built in basic prefabs (player controller, basic enemy types, basic gun patterns, ui elements, among other things)
- Boss variety (ability to write custom behavior for bosses on top of normal enemies, as well as certain already 
premade boss patterns)
- Level design conductor (to script when enemies spawn in what way)
- Text dialog cutscenes
- An upgrade system where the player gets stronger and can gain new abilities

## Contributing

To download and develop on Dog Quest your Unity version must be the same, and you must have git-lfs installed. The
Unity version Dog Quest uses is 2018.3.11f. The Unity asset store has a github package that installs git-lfs for you,
so it is recommended to use that.
